              To ensure equitable access to our mentors and prevent any single
              user from monopolizing their time, we may, at our discretion,
              implement a fair usage policy. An automatic cap of 20 sessions per
              month will be activated if a mentee requests more than 120
              sessions within a 6-month period. However, if a mentee has a valid
              justification for exceeding this limit, they may appeal the cap.
              Each appeal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and our
              decision will be final.
