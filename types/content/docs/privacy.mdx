### Information Provided By You

Upon registering for an Account, we may request your contact details, including but not limited to your name, company name, address, email address, and telephone number. Financial account information provided to your Account is directed to our third-party payment processor.

These identifiers cannot execute as code, deliver viruses, be identifiable to other servers, nor collect personal information.

MentorsCX employs this method solely for aggregating statistics to enhance the user experience. If you prefer not to have these identifiers during your visit, you can disable cookies in your web browser's security settings. It's essential to note that disabling cookies may impact your ability to fully utilize our website or execute functions where cookies are required for security.

### Web-Beacon

A small graphic known as a web beacon may be embedded into MentorsCX advertisements, emails, or web pages. This graphic prompts your web browser to request the beacon from a web server, acquiring a unique identifier that may track visitor movement on the website. MentorsCX utilizes web beacons to offer customized experiences and gather usage statistics for tailoring the viewing experience. The web beacon employed by MentorsCX reads only raw usage statistics and does not access personal information.
