GBC stands for **Give Back to the Community.**

If you are a mentor, you’ve had quite a successful journey in the CX space so far. The GBC approach is a way to give back to the community that has nurtured you through your journey and has helped you get to where you are. A way to gain some karma points and help others achieve what you’ve achieved.

We want a community that has an open heart and is kind to others, always wishing them the best, before thinking of money as the main priority. Allowing some people who can’t afford extra mentor fees to have access to your knowledge, at least temporarily, is a great way to contribute to a kinder world. A way to share world-class skills and advice to others with no additional cost. You heroes out there guiding others into the same or even better journey.

This is why we decided to enable the “charging for your sessions” feature only after you have received four reviews. Why four? We expect most mentors to have 30 min time slots set as their availability, which will equal four mentorship sessions or two hours. We think that’s a reasonable amount of time to give back to the community to then start benefiting from setting a price into the pool of mentees.

Most people will probably not charge for it and decided to be here for different reasons/benefits, like:

- Consulting/long-term opportunities
- Actively challenge my skills
- Keeping my brain sharp in other industries, technologies, ideologies, etc.

Or simple to give back to the community!
