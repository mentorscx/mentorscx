There’s no perfect formula. We designed the request to be simple enough to avoid daunting the mentor, but enough aperture for you to provide sufficient details. Some tips you can follow:

**Objective (in one short sentence)**

Think of this as a descriptive title. It’s just a fast way for the mentor to take a glimpse into what you’re looking for. It also helps you condense what you’re thinking about, giving you more focus and clarity on what your challenge is.

**Skill category you need help with**

It’s better if you are not trying to get too much in your hands. Focus on one particular issue/challenge/topic on the call. Therefore, being able to select one specific skill you are trying to pick the mentor’s brain in has a positive impact.

**What is your main challenge and your expected outcome of the call?**

Be clear in your message. What is the main challenge(s) you’d like to discuss during the call? Being detailed can help the mentor better prepare for the call instead of spending a lot of time on giving more context in the session. Provide as much background as possible, the solutions you’ve tried, why you’re stuck or looking for help, and any resources that might be helpful. This will ensure you have a more fruitful call.

Sharing your expected outcome is crucial too. It will allow the mentor to decide if they can assist you with it or not. If they are the right person to guide you through what you’re going to and help you achieve your goal.
